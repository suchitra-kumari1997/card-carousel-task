                            Maggie Holt is used to such questions. Twenty-five years ago, she and her parents, Ewan and Jess, 
                            moved into Baneberry Hall, a rambling Victorian estate in the Vermont woods. They spent three weeks there
                             before fleeing in the dead of night, an ordeal Ewan later recounted.
                            Today, Maggie is a restorer of old homes and too young to remember any of the events mentioned in her father’s book. 
                            But she also doesn’t believe a word of it. Ghosts, after all, don’t exist. When Maggie inherits Baneberry Hall after
                            her father’s death, she returns to renovate the place to prepare it for sale. But her homecoming is anything but
                            warm. People from the past, chronicled in House of Horrors, lurk in the shadows.

                                    The constant theme in The Alchemist is to pursue your dreams by following what your heart desires.
                                     During the young boy's journey, he learns to listen to the heart and to follow the language of omens.
                                      With each passing obstacle and hurdle that the young boy encounters,
                                     there is a lesson to learn.It follows the journey of an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago. Believing a recurring dream to be prophetic,
                                     he asks a Gypsy fortune teller in the nearby town about its meaning.
                                     The woman interprets the dream as a prophecy telling the boy that he will discover a treasure at the Egyptian
                                      pyramids.

                                    Misery is an American psychological horror thriller novel written by Stephen King and
                                     first published by Viking Press on June 8, 1987.[1] The novel's narrative is based on
                                      the relationship of its two main characters – the popular writer Paul Sheldon and 
                                      his psychotic fan Annie Wilkes. When Paul is seriously injured following a car accident, 
                                      former nurse Annie brings him to her home, where Paul receives treatment and doses of pain medication.
                                     Paul realizes that he is a prisoner and is forced to indulge his captor's whims.
                                     The novel's title has two meanings: it is the name carried by the central heroine of Paul's 
                                     book series, and King described such a state of emotion during the novel's writing.
                                      King has outlined the creation of Misery in his memoirs, 
                                     and mentioned that the image of Annie Wilkes came to him in a dream.

                                     Or why she can never meet for coffee, even though she doesn't work.

                                     who lost her mother tragically as a child. Bailey, who wants absolutely nothing to do with her new stepmother.
